# The connections group holds information about the (server) connections this
# server wil establish and accept.
#
# connectto:
#     Contains the hostname and port numbers of the servers to connect to.
#     Multiple servers can be used here. For example:
#       connectto=server.hinttech.com:5001,server.flightsim.com:4006
# allowfrom:
#     Contains the IP addresses from which servers can connect to this server.
#     Multiple IP addresses can be used, separated by commas. For example:
#        allowfrom=server.flightsim.com,atc.aol.com

# The hosts group contains a list of hosts that are trusted for some activity.
# There are 2 entries:
#    certificates : contains a list of server ID's that are allowed to change
#                   certificates

# This group controls the weather system.
# The 'source' variable determines the source of the METAR data.
# For normal operation, set this to 'network'.
# There are 3 possible values here:
#    'file'      : Read the METAR data from the file 'metar.txt'
#                  and allow weather requests from other servers.
#    'download'  : Like 'file', but refresh metar.txt every hour by downloading
#                  the latest weather observations from metlab. The server has
#                  to be connected to the internet for this to work.
#    'network'   : Relay weather requests to the closest METAR capable server.
#
# 'server','dir' and 'ftpmode' are only used when the METAR source is 'download'. These
# fields determine the host name and the directory from where metar data is
# read. FSD uses the FTP protocol to get the data. ftpmode can have the value 'active'
# 'passive' that are Active and Passive FTP protocol mode, default is 'passive'.
# If you use FSD on a computer having a private IP, only use passive mode.
